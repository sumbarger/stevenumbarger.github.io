  <h1>Outreach</h1>

  <div class="card">
  <p>
    Outreach is a big part of my scientific journey. I have done a lot of things 
    to get the public interested in the field of astronomy. I have made 3D tactile
    models of my work to help teach individuals with visual impairments about space
    as well as being a mentor to high school students in research. Currently, I am
    running the social media team for Ann Arbor Astronomy on Tap. More details about
    my outreach efforts are below.

  <h2>3D Tactile Models</h2>

  <p>
    I utilize software that converts my observational and simulation data into
    tactile models where light is defined by the elevation of the model.
  </p>

  <p>
    I use these models to teach the general public about astronomy.
