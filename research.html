  <h1>Research</h1>

  <div class="card">
  <p>
    My current research focuses on understanding the evolution of galaxies through
    galaxy mergers. I utilize JWST observations to complete my analysis. However,
    in the past I have worked with star clusters in both high-resolution observations
    and cosmological simulations, Weak Carbon-Nitrogen stars, and made astronomy more
    accessible through the use of 3D models. Below is a summary of my current and past
    projects.

  <h2>Keck Adaptive Optics vs. Hubble Imaging of Star Clusters in M31</h2>

  <p>
    I study the structure of star clusters in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) by
    comparing high-resolution adaptive optics observations from the Keck
    Observatory with imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. This project
    investigates how differences in instrumentation, resolution, and observing
    techniques affect measurements of cluster morphology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using Keck NIRC2 images and archival HST data, I perform image processing
    tasks such as sky subtraction and artifact removal, followed by detailed
    visual and quantitative comparisons. I use DS9 and 3D visualization tools
    to examine how cluster features appear across datasets and to assess the
    strengths and limitations of each telescope.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work helps inform best practices for combining space-based and
    ground-based observations when studying dense stellar systems and provides
    insight into how observational choices influence our interpretation of
    star cluster structure.

  <h2>Visualization of FIRE-2 Star Clusters</h2>

  <p>
    A central component of my research is the use of 3D visualization to better
    understand and communicate the structure of star clusters and galaxies. I
    create three-dimensional models from both observational data and simulations
    to explore spatial relationships that are difficult to capture in traditional
    two-dimensional images.
  </p>

  <p>
    I use tools such as Astro3D and custom visualization scripts to transform
    astronomical datasets into interactive and physical models. These visualizations
    support scientific analysis while also serving as powerful tools for outreach
    and education.
  </p>

  <p>
    By integrating visualization directly into the research process, I aim to
    bridge the gap between data analysis, interpretation, and public engagement.

  <h2>Accessibility in Astronomy for the Visually Impaired</h2>

  <p>
    I am actively involved in an outreach-focused research project aimed at making
    astronomy more accessible to individuals with visual impairments. This work
    combines astronomical data with tactile 3D models and sound-based representations
    to create inclusive learning tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    My contributions include generating 3D-printable models of star clusters and
    galactic structures, as well as collaborating on lesson plans that integrate
    these materials into educational settings. I am particularly interested in
    extending these methods to simulation data, allowing learners to physically
    explore theoretical models of galaxy evolution.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project reflects my broader commitment to inclusive science and to
    ensuring that astronomical research and education are accessible to a
    diverse range of audiences.
